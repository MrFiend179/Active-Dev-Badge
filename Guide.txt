To use this script make a discord bot {https://discord.com/developers/applications} and then copy the "Bots Token" and "Bots ID"

Then make a server and make sure that community is enabled in that server

Invite the discord bot to that server and make sure hes has ('bot' and 'application.command' permission checked) in the URL generator

Then download the requisites mentioned below

--The following steps should be performed after node.js has been installed on your pc

1-bioler template (npm init -y) [inside terminal]---

    (Then at 6th line add this ["type": "module",] and make sure to put "," at then end of 5th line)
